## Datasets
We have curated several datasets to train and test our models. Here's a list of them:
- Caramel flavor syrup Sales
- Espresso with cream Sales
- Expresso Data (available in both .xlsx and .csv formats)
- Hazelnut flavor syrup Sales
- Latte Classic Sales
- Cappuccino (both Grande and Classic) Sales
- Espresso (both Lungo and Classic) Sales

## Notebooks
- `Plots.ipynb`: Visualizations and exploratory data analysis of our datasets.
- `main.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the implementation of the Transformer-based sales forecasting model.

## Reports
- `Poster.pdf`: A poster presentation of our project.
- `Report.pdf`: Detailed report on our methodology, results, and findings.

## Web Application - BlueSwan
We have also developed a web application named "BlueSwan" to demonstrate our model's capabilities. Here are some of its main components:
- `app.py`: Main application file.
- `main.py`: Backend logic and model integration.
- `script.js`: Frontend JavaScript functionalities.
- `index.html` & `basic.html`: Frontend design and layout.
- `style.css`: Styling for the web application.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Navigate to the notebooks and run them to understand the model's workings.
4. Launch the BlueSwan web application to see the model in action.
